        <h2 class="body_text_2"><br><br><br><br>In Weltschmerz, you play as a person who lives with his old high school/university Friend. The difficulty in Weltschmerz comes when you discover your old friend has extreme bipolar disorder, and begins to rely on you emotionally. 
<br><br>
The gameplay is akin to a text based adventure, with involved multimedia (music, graphics). You navigate through conversations/engagements with your Friend, and unravel the depth of his illness. 
<br><br>
Weltschmerz is a horror, specifically psychological horror. The content is not comforting by any means. It is purposefully meant to disturb the viewer. 
<br><br>
It is continuous. I thought the idea of an ending, even a sad one, will still elicit some feeling of accomplishment. The game ends when the player finally gives up on the Friend.

        <h2 class="body_text">Everyone has most likely gone through an out of body experience: The feeling of nostalgia for example, is very hard to stick a definition to. Generally when we use the word nostalgia, we’re referring to the sadness that comes with remembering some time in the past that we regard fondly. However, we can use the word nostalgia to relate to the feeling it elicits, rather than the definition itself. When we happen upon this feeling without any indication that we’ve encountered something from our past, we are enigmatic to others. In this sense, a feeling felt by you alone, in which no one else can understand without experiencing, accompanied by a lack of cause, is terrifying. It’s also one of the most prevalent underlying issues in the social cohesion of modern societies; the issue of mental illness.
