        <h2 class="body_text_2">Mental Illness: An analysis into scientific unawareness<br><br></h2>
        <h2 class="body_text">Everyone has most likely gone through an out of body experience: The feeling of nostalgia for example, is very hard to stick a definition to. Generally when we use the word nostalgia, we’re referring to the sadness that comes with remembering some time in the past that we regard fondly. However, we can use the word nostalgia to relate to the feeling it elicits, rather than the definition itself. When we happen upon this feeling without any indication that we’ve encountered something from our past, we are enigmatic to others. In this sense, a feeling felt by you alone, in which no one else can understand without experiencing, accompanied by a lack of cause, is terrifying. It’s also one of the most prevalent underlying issues in the social cohesion of modern societies; the issue of mental illness.
