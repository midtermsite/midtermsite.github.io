        <h2 class="body_text_2"><br><br><br><br>In Weltschmerz, you play as a person who lives with his old high school/university Friend. The difficulty in Weltschmerz comes when you discover your old friend has extreme bipolar disorder, and begins to rely on you emotionally. 
<br><br>
The gameplay is akin to a text based adventure, with involved multimedia (music, graphics). You navigate through conversations/engagements with your Friend, and unravel the depth of his illness. 
<br><br>
Weltschmerz is a horror, specifically psychological horror. The content is not comforting by any means. It is purposefully meant to disturb the viewer. 
<br><br>
It is continuous. I thought the idea of an ending, even a sad one, will still elicit some feeling of accomplishment. The game ends when the player finally gives up on the Friend.

Everyone has most likely gone through an out of body experience: The feeling of nostalgia for example, is very hard to stick a definition to. The word nostalgia refers to the sadness that comes with remembering some time in the past that was regarded fondly. However, the word nostalgia can also be used to describe the feeling it elicits, rather than the definition itself. This feeling and it’s indescribability directly correlate to one of the most prevalent underlying issues in the social cohesion of modern societies; the issue of mental illness, and the lack of medical knowledge surrounding its causes and cures. 
<br><br>
The underlying causes of mental disorders are largely undiscovered. A reported “50% of individuals with severe psychiatric disorders (3.5 million people) are receiving no treatment.[1]” This number is disproportionate. It is also a clear illustration of how little we understand about mental illness. In the United states for example, over 201 billion dollars in 2013 was devoted to treating mental disorders, which comparatively is significantly more investment than any other health condition[2]. We can conclude that the enigmatic causes are a result of many underlying factors, rather than just one. These can range from family genetics, social environment, and even drug use[2]. The characteristic that allows mental illness to stand out in the medical community as cryptic, is that mental illness “has no biological markers that we can see on imaging scans or determine through laboratory tests—to tell us who is affected and who is not. In the aggregate, groups of people who suffer from mental illness may show differences in their brain structures or functions, but for now, individual patients can’t be diagnosed using conventional measures such as blood tests, CT scans, or MRIs.”[2] As such, the reality of detecting mental illness is not promising; the only viable method for observing mental illness in a patient is through analyzing behaviour. 
<br><br>
Cures for the various mental disorders are also in a dismal state, with none suitable in curing the underlying conditions, and only treatment methods used to mitigate the symptoms. A study, Urgent Need for Improved Mental Health Care and a More Collaborative Model of Care, states that “Currently available conventional biomedical treatments, CAM treatments, and the dominant model of care used in the US and other world regions fail to adequately address the complex biological, social, cultural, and spiritual dimensions of mental illness.” With no cure in sight, medical practitioners have focused efforts almost solely on treatment and sustainability. Victims of mental illness can live a normal life, through various means involving psychiatric drug use and psychotherapy[4]. Although these methods mitigate the symptoms of various mental disorders, they will never act as a suitable cure. “At this time, most mental illnesses cannot be cured, but they can usually be treated effectively to minimize the symptoms and allow the individual to function in work, school, or social environments.[5]”
<br><br>
It is predicted that one in four people will be affected by mental or neurological illness in their lifetime. Of these, two thirds will never seek medical attention[6]. Mental illness is prevalent in our society, and yet the search for suitable cures and causes of such disorders still remain unknown to modern medicine.
